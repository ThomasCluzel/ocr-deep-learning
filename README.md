# Neuronal character recognition

This project is a first year project of two ISIMA students (ZZ1).
Our goal is to turn a picture of a text into a plain text.

## Why this project?

There is a couple of reasons :
* a plain text is lighter to store than a picture
* it is easier to search a word in a plain text than a picture
* etc

## The two parts of the convertion

### The detection part

First and foremost, we look for characters on the picture.

### The recognition part

Afterward, once we have figured out where the characters are, we try to
guess what characters they actually are.
We manage this with a convolutional neural network.
